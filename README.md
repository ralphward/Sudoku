Simple sudoku solver

This is a project I started for fun about 7 years ago when I was doing a lot of Sudoku puzzles - it solves sudoku puzzles using the same methods a human would use. There are quite a few problems with the code that I may get around to fixing one day, but it does manage to solve a lot of sudoku puzzles
