Simple sudoku solver

This is a project I started for fun about 7 years ago when I was doing a lot of Sudoku puzzles for fun - it's solves sudoku puzzles without brute forcing it. There are quite a few problems with the code that I may get around to fixing one day, but it does manage to solve a lot of sudoku puzzles
